# 🤖 DevOps Automation Roadmap (In-Depth)

## 🛠️ 1. Shell Scripting (Bash)
> Foundation of all automation in Linux environments.

### ✅ Learn:
- Bash syntax: variables, loops, functions, conditions
- Script execution and debugging (`bash -x`, `set -e`)
- Working with files, strings, and system commands
- Cron jobs and background execution

### 🔧 Use For:
- Automating server updates, backups, cron tasks
- Writing entrypoint scripts for Docker

---

## 🧪 2. CI/CD Automation
> Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.

### ✅ Learn:
- Pipeline concepts: stages, jobs, artifacts
- Git-based triggers (push, PR, tag)
- YAML pipeline writing
- Parallel and conditional execution
- Secrets and environment variables handling

### 🔧 Use For:
- Automating code build, test, and deployment
- Docker image creation and push
- Slack/email notifications

---

## 📦 3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
> Automate provisioning of servers, VPCs, databases, and network components.

### ✅ Tools:
- Terraform (cloud-agnostic)
- Pulumi (in real code like Python/TS)
- AWS CloudFormation (if AWS-specific)

### ✅ Learn:
- Writing declarative IaC modules
- Variables, outputs, state management
- Remote backends (e.g., S3)
- Terraform Workspaces and modules

### 🔧 Use For:
- Provisioning EC2, S3, VPC, RDS, IAM
- Setting up full cloud infrastructure with a single command

---

## ⚙️ 4. Configuration Management Tools
> Automate configuration and software installation on servers.

### ✅ Tools:
- Ansible (most widely used)
- Chef, Puppet (less common now)

### ✅ Learn (for Ansible):
- Inventory and host groups
- Playbooks, roles, variables
- Modules (e.g., `apt`, `copy`, `service`, `template`)
- Loops and conditionals

### 🔧 Use For:
- Server hardening
- App and DB configuration
- Managing large clusters (e.g., 100+ servers)

---

## 🐳 5. Docker Automation

### ✅ Learn:
- Writing optimized Dockerfile
- `docker-compose.yml` (for multi-container apps)
- Automating image builds and cleanups
- Docker CLI scripting and lifecycle management

### 🔧 Use For:
- Building and running dev/test environments
- Packaging apps for CI/CD

---

## ☸️ 6. Kubernetes Automation

### ✅ Learn:
- Writing `kubectl` automation scripts
- Helm charts (Kubernetes templating)
- Kustomize (YAML overlays)
- Automating rollouts and monitoring

### 🔧 Use For:
- Automating application deployment to K8s
- Managing secrets, configmaps, HPA, PVCs

---

## 📋 7. Monitoring & Alerting Automation

### ✅ Tools:
- Prometheus (monitoring)
- Grafana (dashboards)
- Alertmanager / OpsGenie / PagerDuty (alerting)

### ✅ Learn:
- Automating alert setup with rules
- Creating dashboards as code (Grafana JSON or Terraform)
- Custom metrics and exporters

---

## 📫 8. Notification and Communication Automation

### ✅ Tools:
- Slack, Email, Microsoft Teams APIs
- Webhooks

### ✅ Learn:
- Sending notifications from CI/CD pipelines
- Hooking alerts to Slack or Discord
- Writing webhook receivers in Node.js or Python

---

## 🔐 9. Secrets and Credential Automation

### ✅ Tools:
- HashiCorp Vault
- AWS Secrets Manager / Parameter Store
- sops with GitOps

### ✅ Learn:
- Securely injecting secrets into pipelines and containers
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for secrets
- Encryption at rest/in-transit

---

## 🧰 10. Miscellaneous Automation

### 🔧 Examples:
- Automating cloud cost reports (with CLI + cron)
- Automating testing environments with ephemeral containers
- Auto-scaling setups (HPA, Terraform + Lambda triggers)
- Automating SSL renewal (Let's Encrypt + Certbot + cron)
