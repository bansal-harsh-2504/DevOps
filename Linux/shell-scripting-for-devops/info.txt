1. Get a linux environment 
create a ec2 instance

2. connect - ssh

click on connect on top right of instance page

locate the downloaded .pem key

```
    ssh -i "shell-scripting-devops-key.pem" ubuntu@ec2-15-207-89-160.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```

2. create a script

a. Text editor-> vim
```
    vim hello.txt
```
press i for insert mode

b. To exit

press esc
```
    :wq -> write and quit
or 
    :q! -> quit without saving (force quit)
```

c. To view the file contents
```
    cat hello.txt
```

d. vim hello.sh

write 
```
    #!/bin/bash 
```
so that we can tell which shell to use to execute this script, this line is known as shabang.
there are different shells like sh, bash, fish, csh, zsh etc.
linux kernel was made by linus torvalds and sh was made by steve bourne, he then created bash which is short for bourne again shell.

we can check the location of shell by
``` 
    which bash
```

3. Execute the script

first check the executable permission for the file
```
    ls -l
```

give the execute permission to hello.sh
```
    chmod u+x hello.sh
```

now execute the script
```
./hello.sh or bash hello.sh
```
